Bonuses will be offered to this senior design engineer that can work at a fast pace to produce rapid prototypes and move quickly to meet these product development goals. About Ideal Vacuum Ideal Vacuum is the largest supplier of scientific and industrial vacuum equipment in the southwest. We are a manufacturer of sophisticated environmental simulation instruments, for vacuum applications such as:High Altitude SimulationAerospace Component Environmental TestingSpace Flight Conditions SimulationRocket Launch Thermal Vacuum SimulationOur other vacuum products such as vacuum pumps, valves, and pressure measurement devices are used within an increasingly diverse range of industrial and R&D processes, including solar cell manufacturing, thin-film optical coating applications, quality control processes, analytical chemistry methods, like Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, chemical engineering, and are integrated into various scientific instruments.About This Position Ideal Vacuum is seeking a senior engineer to work on the product development of mechanical scroll and multi-stage blower type vacuum pumps. They are called "dry pumps" because they do not use vacuum pump oil to seal the pumping stages. Being dry, they operate on a non-contact design, where high-speed rotors are mounted very close to stationary stators, this is in some ways like a turbo or supercharger in a performance sports car. The fast-rotating speed and close tolerance keeps airflow moving forward while limiting backwards migration of gases. A key technical challenge is to correctly address thermal expansion, to maintain the close tolerances between fix and moving components. Elegant and innovative designs are needed, which will correctly manage thermal expansion caused by the heat generated as the gases are compressed in the vacuum generating process; while simultaneously preventing component contact which would cause the pump to seize.  This Senior Mechanical Engineer will lead the Product Development team to design, analyze, test, and validate these new vacuum pumps through the full Product Life Cycle, from concept, the initial sale, to product service. This will involve developing and implementing innovative solutions, leading the product development process, and delivering these projects on time.

About Ideal Vacuum Ideal Vacuum is the largest supplier of scientific and industrial vacuum equipment in the southwest. We are a manufacturer of sophisticated environmental simulation instruments, for vacuum applications such as:High Altitude SimulationAerospace Component Environmental TestingSpace Flight Conditions SimulationRocket Launch Thermal Vacuum SimulationOur other vacuum products such as vacuum pumps, valves, and pressure measurement devices are used within an increasingly diverse range of industrial and R&D processes, including solar cell manufacturing, thin-film optical coating applications, quality control processes, analytical chemistry methods, like Raman spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, chemical engineering, and are integrated into various scientific instruments.About This Position Ideal Vacuum is seeking a senior engineer to work on the product development of mechanical scroll and multi-stage blower type vacuum pumps. They are called "dry pumps" because they do not use vacuum pump oil to seal the pumping stages. Being dry, they operate on a non-contact design, where high-speed rotors are mounted very close to stationary stators, this is in some ways like a turbo or supercharger in a performance sports car. The fast-rotating speed and close tolerance keeps airflow moving forward while limiting backwards migration of gases. A key technical challenge is to correctly address thermal expansion, to maintain the close tolerances between fix and moving components. Elegant and innovative designs are needed, which will correctly manage thermal expansion caused by the heat generated as the gases are compressed in the vacuum generating process; while simultaneously preventing component contact which would cause the pump to seize.  This Senior Mechanical Engineer will lead the Product Development team to design, analyze, test, and validate these new vacuum pumps through the full Product Life Cycle, from concept, the initial sale, to product service. This will involve developing and implementing innovative solutions, leading the product development process, and delivering these projects on time.
