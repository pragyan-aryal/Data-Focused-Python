Our core technology is the smallest, fastest, and most electrically efficient compression mount connector technology worldwide. As data rate requirements increase and devices and systems shrink, Ardent’s products deliver superior signal integrity in a dense footprint that can be reusable across programs to maximize cost savings. Our focus is on helping bring next generation computing to market through novel connector designs for test & measurement, OEM applications, and specialized military applications. Ardent’s patented contact technologies are well suited for advanced multi-GHz applications such as board stack connectors, coaxial connectors, FPGA sockets, flex circuit connectors, probe interfaces, and mezzanine card connectors. We have a complete line of high-performance test socket solutions for the most advanced chipsets such as RF devices, ASICS, switches, processors, and MEMS devices. We support chip to chip, chip to board, board to board, and flex to board applications. We are currently seeking a Senior Product Development Engineer to lead our team in creating next generation copper interconnects. Ardent has experienced explosive growth in the last 5 years and it is imperative that we stay ahead of the technology requirements. We are looking for a senior product designer to help us develop the copper transmission lines of the future. This position is located in our Hampton Beach, NH office.
